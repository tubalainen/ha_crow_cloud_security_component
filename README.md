Shepard Crow Security Custom Component

This repository is a re-vival of the deleteted custom component repository from @shprota.

It has an updated alarm_control_panel.py and sensor.py component that works with Home Assistant 2025.x

Installation is made manually, copy the crow folder into your custom_components folder, restart and then add the component.

This component is very rudimentary and basic. Really apprechiate any help to update features and implement the rest of the crow security API featureset.
